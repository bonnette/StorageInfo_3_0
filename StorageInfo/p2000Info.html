<h3><strong>HPE MSA Storage Overview:</strong></h3>
<h3>MSA 2042</h3>

Would you like to accelerate your performance-hungry applications with flash storage? The HPE MSA 2042 SAN Storage offers an entry level storage platform with built-in hybrid flash for application acceleration and high-performance. It is ideal for performance-hungry applications and includes 800 GB of Solid State Drive (SSD) capacity.<br />
    <br />
    The all-inclusive set and forget software suite includes built-in, real-time data tiering that dynamically moves frequently used data to flash and less used data to lower-cost media tiers. This suite also includes 512 snapshots out-of-the-box for instant recovery, and remote replication for affordable application availability.<br />
    <br />
    The software delivers management tools that are ideal for IT generalists and server administrators. The MSA 2042 allows for flexible growth now and into the future.<br />
    <br />
    Data-in-place upgrades reduce data migration and drive investments. Start small and scale as needed with any combination of SSD, SAS or midline SAS drives.
<h3>MSA 2040</h3>
<p>Changing storage requirements have raised the bar for entry shared storage 
arrays. The MSA 2040 uniquely addresses HPE ProLiant and BladeSystem server 
customersâ€™ shared storage and data protection needs, reducing total cost of 
ownership while dramatically increasing performance and availability utilizing 
technologies such as SSDs, Self-Encrypted Drives (SEDs), and a host on advanced 
data services previously only available on mid-range and enterprise
disk arrays. </p>
<p>The HPE MSA 2040 Storage arrays are positioned to provide an excellent value 
for customers needing increased performance to support initiatives such as 
consolidation and virtualization.<br />
</p>
<p>The MSA 2040 delivers this performance by leveraging a new, fourth 
generation, controller architecture with more processing resources, 4 GB cache 
per controller and four host ports per controller standard. The controller 
architecture delivers incredible performance and allows users to extract full 
benefits from the latest storage technologies such as SSDs.</p>
<h3>MSA 1040</h3>
<p>Entry consolidation and virtualization initiatives are now well within your 
budgetary reach. HPE MSA 1040 Storage offers many of the MSA 2040 features but at 
lower entry price
points. ProLiant and BladeSystems administrators as well as IT generalists will 
find storage management tasks simple and intuitive with MSA.<br />
</p>
<p>The MSA 1040 arrays leverage a new fourth-generation controller architecture 
with a new processor, 2-host ports and 4 GB cache per controller. Take advantage 
of the latest hard drive advances by selecting the HDD form factor and 
technology which best meet your application and budget requirements. </p>
<p>Unlike many competing arrays, the MSA 1040 ships standard with intuitive 
management tools and powerful data services such as snapshots and Volume Copy 
for increased data protection.</p>
