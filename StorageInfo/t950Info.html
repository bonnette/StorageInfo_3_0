<h3><strong>HPE T950 Tape Library Overview:</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
  <p>  The HPE T950 Tape Library combines field-proven reliability with storage innovation, the HPE T950 gives you access to a full suite of enterprise capabilities. The T950 delivers powerful library management, superior and proactive data integrity administration, and the best total cost of ownership of any tape solution. Once data expands beyond the limits of your initial T950 configuration, you simply add expansion frames to keep growing. The T950 can expand up to 120 drives and 10,020 LTO slots (7,614 enterprise slots) in eight frames. With versatile built-in BlueScale software interface you have intelligent command, control and data integrity functionality at the touch of a screen. The T950, with its compact footprint, is installed in some of the worldâ€™s most high-profile organizations to meet their backup, archive and deep storage requirements.
  <h4>High Performance</h4>
  <p>HPE T950 tape libraries are built with the highest performance achievable in automated tape technology. From robotics, to drives, to software, to media all performance innovations are included in these libraries.</p>
  <p>The transporter has been designed with two primary goals: performance and reliability. These are accomplished by reduced cycle time or tape mount time (better performance) and increased mean time between failures (better reliability).</p>
  <p>Coupled with the ability to support different types of tape media, organizations free themselves from vendor lock-in, and provide superior flexibility.</p>
  <h4>High Capacity</h4>
  <p>When data center real-estate counts, HPE&rsquo;s T950 offers you unsurpassed storage density and the smallest footprint through a unique and highly efficient library design. More storage capacity in less floor space.</p>
  <p>Using innovative &ldquo;shelves&rdquo; instead of slots, and TeraPack containers in place of individual cartridges; HPE&rsquo;s T950 tape library uses 20% floor space required versus competing offerings.</p>
  <p>The highly compact library design is also built to fit into a standard rack-row layout, fitting co-located &amp; standardized data center designs that don&rsquo;t easily accommodate non-standard equipment. These significant space-saving benefits allow you to use floor space for operations other than storage.</p>
  <p>Only buy what you need today and add storage capacity as you need it. Upgrade capacity in intervals of 10 LTO or 9 Enterprise tape slots at a time. Tape consolidation through capacity, performance, partitioning and reporting results in a lower total cost of ownership.</p>
