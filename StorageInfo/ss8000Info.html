	<p>HPE 3PAR StoreServ 8000 is storage made effortless.</p>
	<p><strong>Efficient</strong></p>
	<p>Get thin and stay thin – Thin technologies    unique to the HPE 3PAR StoreServ family can reduce capacity requirements by    50%. Purchase only what you need, as you need it so you can focus resources    on growing your business, not maintaining your storage.&nbsp; Additionally, the HPE 3PAR Gen5 ASIC with Thin    Built In features an efficient, silicon-based zero-detection mechanism.&nbsp; This unique hardware capability gives HPE    3PAR StoreServ Storage the power to remove allocated but unused space without    impacting performance.<br />
	  Data center virtualization – Increase    virtualization return on investment. Double virtual machine density on your    physical servers, spend up to 90 percent less time managing your storage, and    support your virtualization deployment with 50 percent less storage capacity.    HPE 3PAR StoreServ is built from the ground up to deliver performance that    exceeds the demands of virtualized data centers along with transformative    levels of simplicity, agility, and efficiency. <br />
	  Service levels – With policy-based    autonomic sub-LUN tiering, you can balance the cost of capacity and the cost    of performance and put the right data on the right storage tier at the right    time.<br />
	  Do more with less – With HPE 3PAR StoreServ    Storage you can purchase up to 75 percent less capacity—meaning less    equipment to house, fewer disks to power and cool, less hardware to retire    after it has reached its end of life, and a reduced carbon footprint.</p>
	<p><strong>Autonomic</strong></p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s like breathing—you don&rsquo;t even have to    think about it. Simplify, automate, and expedite storage management by    handling storage provisioning, tiering, and change management    autonomically—intelligently, at a sub-system level, and without administrator    intervention.<br />
SmartStart Software – software designed to    get you off to a quick start with your new HPE 3PAR StoreServ 8000 system.<br />
Common architecture – Access the same    features as the world&rsquo;s largest service providers with a common architecture    that meets SMB needs and spans to the largest global enterprise</p>
	<p><strong>Resilient</strong></p>
	<p>Secure multi-tenancy - Consolidate with    confidence. Achieve higher service levels for more users and applications    with less infrastructure. HPE 3PAR StoreServ Storage is designed to support    massive consolidation by supporting mixed workloads and secure administrative    segregation of users, hosts, and application data. Deliver higher performance    levels, greater availability, and next-generation functionality to multiple    user groups and applications from a single storage system.<br />
Scalable – HPE 3PAR StoreServ 8000 provides    affordable entry pricing and unique, non-disruptive scalability to four    nodes.<br />
High Availability - Featuring the same    mesh-active architecture as all HPE 3PAR StoreServ products, HPE 3PAR StoreServ    8000 offers the highest levels of data availability and protection for the    midrange. Intelligent data striping across all available enclosures provides    HA Cage, the ability to maintain availability even when a whole drive    enclosure fails.  HPE 3PAR Persistent    Cache in four node configurations eliminates performance impacts that result    from unplanned component failures, making it a must-have for maintaining    service levels in the virtual data center—a feature that you can&rsquo;t get from    any other midrange storage platform.<br />
Storage federation - Meet the needs of    today&rsquo;s data center with the ability to move data and workloads between    arrays without impact to applications, users, or services. Simply and    non-disruptively shift data between any model HPE 3PAR StoreServ system    without additional management layers or appliances. Storage federation on HPE    3PAR StoreServ Storage can also help you improve availability in clustered    VMware environments.<br />
Mixed workload - Mixed workload support    serves transactional and througHPEut-intensive workloads from a single device.  The purpose-built HPE 3PAR ASIC delivers    mixed workload support to alleviate performance concerns and cut traditional    array costs. Transaction- and througHPEut-intensive workloads run on the same    storage resources without contention, thereby cutting array purchases in    half.</p>
