<h3><strong>HPE StoreEver MSL Overview:</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
  <p>  The HPE StoreEver MSL Tape Libraries meet demanding storage requirement of businesses needing unattended backup, 
  disaster recovery, or archive capability. The MSL Libraries offer a broad choice of storage capacity and interfaces 
  with LTO-6, LTO-5, or LTO-4 Ultrium tape drives. Web-based remote management makes the MSL Libraries easily 
  managed from across the room or across the globe, eliminating the need for remote office IT staff. Quickly and simply 
  manage the tape media both in and out of the library with the standard bar code reader, configurable mail slots, and 
  multiple 12-slot removable magazines. If a tape were lost or stolen, protect important business data from unauthorized 
  access with the library-based encryption option. Library investment and uncertain data growth are easily managed with 
  MSL accessory kits. Quickly increase capacity and/or performance with tool-free drive upgrades, slot license capacity 
  upgrades, or library expandability.
